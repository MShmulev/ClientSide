   <p2>My name is Moshe Shmulevich I live in Dimona and I will be 27 years old next month.</br>
    I've finished my 12 years of study at the air force techni school in Beer-Sheva.</br>
    After that I've served in Iron Dome through the years of 2014 to 2017 as a technician.</br>
    Now I'm a first year student in the software engineering department at the technological college.</br>
    I hope to finish the course successfully and with a high grade.
